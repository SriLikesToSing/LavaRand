        how the randomness is going to work:
            the layers
        - trades will occur from every 5 to idk how much should be the max number of minutes 
            - make it normally distributed
                - how many cryptos it will invest in at once **nah?
                    - how much total money it will invest in (only make this normally distributed?)
                        - what the splits are going to be 
            - repeat the following steps every 5 minutes (idk what the perfect time is)
                - if percentage is negative then slap me super hard and shoot me

        How is the game going to work?:
        - stop timer; don't start until finished with buying or selling process
           - choose to either sell or buy 
                - 
    
        - have to worry about commission fees
            - can just subtract them later

        The Game:
            - pick either sell or buy every 5, 10, 15, 30 60 minutes (dunno how long to run the experiment)
                - get slapped or shot whenever you lose money after calculated percentage

            - before timer starts decide to sell or trade
                - if it sells stop timer and SELL ALL!
                    - calculate how many companies will be sold
                        - shoot if you lost money; else miss on purpose?

                - if buy then pick amount of companies to invest in 
                    - pick amount and split the money by distributions
                        - restart the timer
