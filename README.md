# Lava Rand - A lava lamp that produces truly random numbers 


How it works:

Lava rand works through a web cam stream that takes in random noise through the random fluctuations of a lava lamp. 
The stream is constantly converted into a binary version of the image and inputs that random binary data as a seed 
of a psuedo random number generator in order to produce random numbers in mass quantity.
