Lava Rand is a lava lamp that produces random numbers through stochastic physical processes.

## Usage

```
$ download my software and run pip install requirements.txt to install dependancies.
$ run python3 randomGenerator.py. 
$ That's it! If you want to produce your own randomly generated seed get your own lavalamp and run cameraStream.py.

```
