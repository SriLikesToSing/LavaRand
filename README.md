Lava Rand is a lava lamp that produces random numbers through stochastic physical processes.

## Usage

```
$ download my software and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.
$ run python randomGenerator.py. 
$ That's it! If you want to produce your own randomly generated seed get your own lavalamp and run
 python cameraStream.py
(Press spacebar to take pictures of lavalamp, and esc to exit)

```
